# Automatic control
This repository contains my files written during the academic course "Controlli Automatici" at Politecnico di Torino. Academic year 2016-2017.
The exercises consist of the development of a controller according to some constraints and which guarantees performance according to some requirements.
The development of those exercises was made in MATLAB exploiting the Simulink environement, too.
